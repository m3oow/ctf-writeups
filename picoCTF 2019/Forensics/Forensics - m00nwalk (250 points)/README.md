## Walkthrough

The hints are helping a lot here, and after some search [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11#Films_and_documentaries) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_missing_tapes), we learn that SSTV (Slow-Scan Television) was the protocole used to transmit pictures from the moon landing to earth.
